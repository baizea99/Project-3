# Building a Sentiment Model with Streamlit and Docker

```
   This Model is used to predict the review of Movies using IMDB dataset. for a complete understanding of how got the results here's the overview of the project:
 
  - Machine Learning Introduction: We'll start by providing you with a brief introduction to Machine Learning, ensuring that even beginners can follow along.

  - IMDb Review Dataset Loading: You'll learn how to load the IMDb review dataset, which is a popular dataset for sentiment analysis tasks.

  - TF-IDF Transformation: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), a common technique for text analysis

  - Model Training: Training our machine learning model using the training data.

  - Prediction: We trained model to make predictions on new data.

  - Evaluation: to evaluate the performance of your sentiment classification model and interpret the results 

  - Docker: Create images for portability.
  
  - POSTGRES: Persistent and Permanent of Dataset.
