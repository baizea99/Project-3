## Data

We reviewed datasets that provided the most opportunity for a thorough exploration of our key questions:

* [Emotions Dataset](!https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/praveengovi/emotions-dataset-for-nlp?resource=download)

## Project Management
|  Phases | Details|
| :--- | :--- |
| Data Fetching  | Google searches, Kaggle, EPI Data Library, Census API search    |
| Software Version Control | Repository created on GitHub, GitHub Projects used to create and track tasks based on key questions, Git branch used to upload files to from local computer to remote repository, utilized "compare & pull requests" to compare branch changes before merging into the main branch correlation, comparison, summary statistics, sentiment analysis, and time series analysis   |
| EDA | Imported CSV files, created dataframes, utlized pandas and python functions to search, select and handle missing data movies and economoic dataset, identified keys features , experience levels, skills, and employment trends for further analysis    |
| Preprocessing  |  Utilized dictionarys, list, loops, column slicing, string manipulation, and train-test split to prevent data leakage and ensure high quality and structured data is visualized and fed into the models for linear regression predictions and classification   |
| Model Selection & Tuning |  Utilized dictionarys, list, loops, column slicing, string manipulation, to ensure high quality and structured data is visualized and fed into the models for linear regression predictions and classification   |

## Methods 

* VADER Sentiment Analysis
  * Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADER) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool specifically designed for social media text. It uses a combination of sentiment lexicon and grammatical rules to analyze the sentiment of text data. VADER is known for its simplicity and effectiveness in analyzing sentiment in short texts like tweets, reviews, and comments. It provides a sentiment score ranging from -1 (negative) to 1 (positive) for each text input, along with scores for neutrality and compound sentiment. VADER is widely used for social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and sentiment analysis tasks where context and tone are important.

* BERT Sentiment Analysis
  * Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is a transformer-based machine learning technique for natural language processing (NLP) pre-training developed by Google. BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of NLP tasks. BERT has been widely adopted in academia and industry for various NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, question answering, and named entity recognition.
